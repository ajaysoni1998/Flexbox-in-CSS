1. justify-content : The `justify-content` property in CSS Flexbox is used to control the alignment and 
distribution of flex items along the main axis of a flex container. It allows you to specify how the available 
space should be distributed between or around the flex items, adjusting their positioning within the container. 
Common values include `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly`, 
each affecting the arrangement of items differently along the main axis.

2. align-items : The `align-items` property in CSS Flexbox is used to control the alignment of flex items along 
the cross axis of a flex container. It allows you to specify how flex items should be aligned vertically
(in a row) or horizontally (in a column) within the container. Common values include `flex-start`, `flex-end`,
 `center`, `baseline`, and `stretch`, each affecting the vertical alignment of items within the container.

3. gap : In CSS Flexbox, the `gap` property (or its older counterpart, `gap`) is used to specify the space 
between flex items in a flex container. It controls the gap between items along the main axis and the cross axis.
This property simplifies the process of adding space between items, making layout design more efficient.

4. flex-direction : In CSS Flexbox, `flex-direction` is a property used to define the direction in which flex 
items are arranged within a flex container. It can be set to values like `row` (horizontally left to right), 
`row-reverse` (horizontally right to left), `column` (vertically top to bottom), or `column-reverse` 
(vertically bottom to top), determining the main axis direction of the layout.

5. flex-wrap : In CSS Flexbox, `flex-wrap` is a property that controls whether flex items should wrap to the next
 line when they can't fit within the width of the flex container. It can have values like `nowrap` (no wrapping),
`wrap` (wrap to the next line if needed), or `wrap-reverse` (wrap to the next line in reverse order). This 
property determines how flex items handle overflow within the container.
