CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are two distinct layout models in CSS, each with its own set of features and use cases. 
Here are the main differences between them and when to choose one over the other:

CSS Flexbox:
1. One-Dimensional Layout: Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either as a row or a column. 
   It's great for arranging items in a single line, like navigation menus or lists.
2. Content-Based Sizing: Flexbox adjusts the size of items based on their content, making it ideal for variable
   content lengths.
3. Ordering: You can easily change the order of flex items using the `order` property.
4. Alignment: Flexbox provides powerful alignment capabilities for items along the main and cross axes.
5. Space Distribution: Flexbox allows you to distribute space within a container using properties like 
   `justify-content` and `align-content`.

CSS Grid:
1. Two-Dimensional Layout: CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, where you can define both rows 
   and columns. It's perfect for creating complex layouts like grids and masonry layouts.
2. Fixed and Flexible Sizing: Grid allows you to set fixed sizes for rows and columns, making it suitable for 
   grid-based designs.
3. Item Placement: Grid provides explicit control over where items are placed within the grid, allowing you to
   specify both row 
   and column positions.
4. Alignment: Grid also offers alignment properties, but they work in both dimensions.
5. Overlap: You can overlap grid items, which is not as straightforward in Flexbox.

When to Choose Flexbox:
Use Flexbox when you have a one-dimensional layout and need to arrange items in a single row or column.
 Examples of when to use Flexbox include:
- Creating navigation menus.
- Aligning items within a header or footer.
- Stacking elements in a column.
- Distributing space along a single axis.

When to Choose Grid:
Choose Grid when you need a two-dimensional layout with rows and columns. Grid is well-suited for:
- Complex grid-based designs, like magazine-style layouts.
- Creating responsive, structured layouts.
- Aligning and positioning elements precisely within a grid.
- Designing card-based or masonry layouts.

In many cases, you may also find that a combination of both Flexbox and Grid is useful.
 For example, you can use Grid to create the overall layout structure and Flexbox within 
 individual grid items to control their internal structure and alignment. The choice between 
 Flexbox and Grid depends on the specific requirements of your layout and design.
